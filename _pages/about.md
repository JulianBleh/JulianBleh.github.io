## Research profile

My research concerns our ability to imagine social change and how envisioning an alternative to the status quo relates to collective action. More specifically, what enables us to imagine a more sustainable, just, democratic and solidaric society? Under which conditions do societal visions, like utopias, motivate us to act upon socio-ecological change, and what role do social identity processes play in this? Further, I'm interested in the social psychological effects of social movements, and I evaluate projects and facilitate processes dealing with socio-ecological change, political participation, transformative education, as well as climate communications.
